# OpenNMS Tutorials

Git Repository of OpenNMS tutorial examples

This is tutorial is version 2025-Horizon33 targeting OpenNMS Horizon 33 / Meridian 2025.

**Note** The videos with eash session are from a previous version of this tutorial. 
  They are still mostly aligned with the content but new videos will be created for this version once it fully updated.

For previous versions of this tutorial see [Version History](../main/versionHistory.md)

The repository contains a number of example projects, exercises and an area called [myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork/) for you to create and store your own example work during the course. 
As you work through the sessions, you should copy each example session into your own [myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork/) space and work on it there. 
That way you commit save your work in your own repository while still being able to receive updates from the upstream master repository.

Please read and follow the Getting Started instructions below before doing anything else.
